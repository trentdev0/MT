# MT
## About
MT is a NT-like operating system for *amd64* PC-compatibles.
Currently, the bootloader is being developed. The reason for creating a custom bootloader is so that it can load PE executables, which is the preferred executable format for MT. There aren't really any open-source bootloaders out there that can load PE executables, therefore we're developing one here.
